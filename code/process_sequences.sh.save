 Make good use of defensive programming (check to make sure there is a command line argument, like we did for last assignment, and if there isn't one or there is more than one, print out some helpful messages).
Use lots of commenting in the code, and numerous `echo` statements to 
provide context for the quantitative output and to orient the user. Use 
`zcat` and `zgrep` (which are like the normal `cat` and `grep` but can 
work directly with compressed files) in combination with other tools 
(e.g. sort, uniq, cut, awk, bioawk, etc), connected by pipes, to process 
the compressed file directly, without decompressing it or moving it from 
its original location. Calculate and report out the total number of 
sequences in the file. Tally up the number of SARS-CoV-2 sequences in 
the dataset from each country and sort this output from largest to 
smallest. OPTIONAL: If you want to challenge yourself, have your script 
also count up the number of sequences in the file that have more than 
29,000 base pairs in them (this is close to the length of the full 
SARS-CoV-2 genome) and the number that have less than 29,000 base pairs.
